%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Document Setup %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Don't like 10pt? Try 11pt or 12pt
\documentclass[10pt]{article}
\RequirePackage[T1]{fontenc}

% LaTeX will typeset using Computer Modern Roman, which a lot of
% non-mathematicians and non-engineers won't like. Also, a few PDF
% viewers may not render CMR very well. Instead, Times New Roman can
% be used. That's what this package does.
\usepackage{times}

% The automated optical recognition software used to digitize resume
% information works best with fonts that do not have serifs. This
% command uses a sans serif font throughout. Uncomment both lines (or at
% least the second) to restore a Roman font (i.e., a font with serifs).
% (NOTE: This requires the times package above)
%\renewcommand{\familydefault}{\sfdefault}

% This is a helpful package that puts math inside length specifications
\usepackage{calc}

% This package helps LaTeX auto-hyphenate hyphenated words if you use
% special hyphens. For example, bio\-/mimicry will properly hyphenate
% ``mimicry'' if necessary.
\usepackage[shortcuts]{extdash}

% Layout: Puts the section titles on left side of page
\reversemarginpar

%
%         PAPER SIZE, PAGE NUMBER, AND DOCUMENT LAYOUT NOTES:
%
% The next \usepackage line changes the layout for CV style section
% headings as marginal notes. It also sets up the paper size as either
% letter or A4. By default, letter was used. If A4 paper is desired,
% comment out the letterpaper lines and uncomment the a4paper lines.
%
% As you can see, the margin widths and section title widths can be
% easily adjusted.
%
% ALSO: Notice that the includefoot option can be commented OUT in order
% to put the PAGE NUMBER *IN* the bottom margin. This will make the
% effective text area larger.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE THE ``of LASTPAGE'' next to each page number,
% see the note about the +LP and -LP lines below. Comment out the +LP
% and uncomment the -LP.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE PAGE NUMBERS, be sure that the includefoot line
% is uncommented and ALSO uncomment the \pagestyle{empty} a few lines
% below.

%%% HEADING AT TOP OF CURRICULUM VITAE

% The title (name) with a horizontal rule under it
% (optional argument typesets an object right-justified across from name
%  as well)
%
% Usage: \makeheading{name}
%        OR
%        \makeheading[right_object]{name}
%
% Place at top of document. It should be the first thing.
% If ``right_object'' is provided in the square-braced optional
% argument, it will be right justified on the same line as ``name'' at
% the top of the CV. For example:
%
%       \makeheading[\emph{Curriculum vitae}]{Your Name}
%
% will put an emphasized ``Curriculum vitae'' at the top of the document
% as a title. Likewise, a picture could be included:
%
%   \makeheading[{\includegraphics[height=1.5in]{my_picture}}]{Your Name}
%
% the picture will be flush right across from the name. For this example
% to work, make sure the extra set of curly braces is included. Also

``Remote, Independent, Friendly Logger for the Environment".  The Riffle Project is the Open Water Project's first set of environmental monitor prototypes, designed specifically for water quality and air quality applications. The Riffle development goal is to create an environmental data logger that will be low-cost, fully open-source (software, hardware, and with a non-proprietary data format), and  accessible, while being advanced enough to leverage cutting-edge electronics, microfluidics, and communications technologies.  
Our initial set of collaborators on the project has included:

\emph{Project Co-Lead, Developer} \hfill {Summer 2014 to present} 

\halfblankline

The Coqui is an electronics sensor platform intended to leverage common intuitions about the relationship between sound, light, and physical properties (e.g., ``higher frequency flashes or sounds $\Rightarrow$ more alarming") in order to render civic technologies as accessible and useful as possible. The design of the device is also intended to highlight assumptions made by civic tech developers around what perspectives and reactions are shared by their target publics.  Because versions of the device could be used for medical applications, it also aims to provoke reflection on certification, regulation, and restrictions on the development of DIY civic technologies.
    \begin{innerlist}
        \item Initial design developed collaboratively on publiclab.org
\item Further development at MIT Open Water workshops
\item Adopted by Florida International University for workshop on sea level rise

Catherine D'Ignazio's Babbling Brook Project  (see \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yP3mvWlxwxE}{demo video}) is a public art installation that measures local environmental conditions, combines these measurements with insights derived from live, web-based weather data, and reports on these conditions (via a speaker system) to the public.  The installation uses accessible, open hardware based on low-cost, popular educational and hobby electronics to provide students, scientists, and community organizers with a platform for delivering 'jokes about the weather' that help to relate global climate conditions to local 'microclimates'. Planned initial installations include a site at the \href{http://tidmarsh.media.mit.edu/}{Tidmarsh Living Observatory} as well as a public location on the MIT Campus during finals week.  Collaborators include:

\emph{Theory, Computer Simulation} 

\halfblankline

Performed Brownian dynamics simulations of the sublimation kinetics of colloidal crystallites, and found an abrupt increase in the sublimation rate at a particular crystallite size, elucidating the results of
recent colloidal experiments. Explored possibility that crossover in the kinetics is due to the thermally activated
introduction of a disclination charge leading to large internal stresses that result in a fission event, and a
break-up of the remaining crystallite. Currently developing an alternative, droplet-evaporation
model for the same phenomenon.

Used Swendsen-Wang Monte Carlo simulations in order to measure the scaling behavior of the fractal
dimension of the diameter $D$ of q-state Potts Model clusters, where $D$ is defined in the graph-theoretic
sense of the ``longest shortest path" along bonds in a cluster. Developed a novel algorithm for
determining $D$ efficiently, and present results for $q = 1, 2, 3, 4$ in 2D and 3D lattices. Attempting to

Employed analytic and simulated annealing methods to study the packing of squares on a flat torus, and

annealing algorithm to explore the densest packings of additional shapes in finite and compact geometries, as well as an exploration of the dependence of packing density and patterns on particle aspect ratio.

\href{http://dwblair.github.io}{\textbf{Computational Complexity}} \hfill {with J. Machta} \\
\emph{Theory, Computer Simulation} 

\halfblankline

Motivated both by recent attempts to elucidate the nature of ``phase transitions" in computational complexity, and by the general project of characterizing the complexity physical systems according to their
``parallel computational depth", explored the parallel computational complexity of the Percolation
(Potts q = 1) model. Developed an algorithm for identifying infinite clusters at bond occupation
probabilities p above the critical value $p_{c}$ , and found (via numerical Monte Carlo simulation) a
phase transition in computational complexity at $p_{c}$, thus relating a phase transition in computational
complexity to a structural phase transition.
